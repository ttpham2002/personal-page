👩‍🎓 I am a junior majoring in Molecular & Cell Biology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. <br>

👩‍🔬 I am passionate about healthcare and my research interests lie in wound healing and drug development. <br>

🛫 I grew up in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 🇻🇳. I enjoy traveling and exploring different cultures and cuisines! 


# Research

- I am currently working under the guidance of Professor [William Bement](https://bement.cellimaging.wisc.edu/) to investigate the pathways of wound healing in single cells via *Xenopus Laevis*.
  
- While in Vietnam, I have worked under Professor Nguyen Thi Hai Yen to explore the cost implications of therapeutic drugs, focusing on pre- and post-implementation analysis. 

# Volunteering 
- I am working as a volunteer at the [UW Health University Hospital](https://www.uwhealth.org/locations/university-hospital-170) in the Medical & Surgery Short Stay unit. I provide escort services, and maintain adequate supply levels by restocking essential items.
